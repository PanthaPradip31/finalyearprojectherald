## Data Storage

All data is stored in **localStorage** for simplicity:

\`\`\`javascript
// Storage Keys
pubg-teams        // Team roster data
pubg-tournament   // Tournament configuration
pubg-standings    // Current standings
pubg-match        // Current match state
pubg-killfeed     // Kill feed history
pubg-analytics    // Match history and stats
\`\`\`

### Exporting Data

From the Analytics page:
- **CSV Export:** Spreadsheet-compatible format
- **JSON Export:** Full data backup
- **Social Text:** Ready-to-post tournament summary

### Clearing Data

To reset all data, open browser DevTools:
\`\`\`javascript
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

### Overlays not updating in OBS

1. Ensure both admin and overlay are on the same origin
2. Refresh the browser source in OBS
3. Check that the match is in "active" state

### Kill feed not showing

1. Verify kill was recorded (check admin panel)
2. Ensure kill feed overlay is loaded (`/overlay/killfeed`)
3. Check browser console for errors

### Team logos not displaying

1. Verify logo URL is accessible (not blocked by CORS)
2. Use direct image URLs (ending in .png, .jpg, etc.)
3. Consider hosting logos locally in `/public/logos/`

### Points not calculating correctly

1. Check placement is recorded when team is eliminated
2. Verify point system is configured in tournament settings
3. Ensure match is ended properly to finalize placements

### Real-time sync not working

1. All tabs must be on the same origin (localhost:3000)
2. BroadcastChannel requires same-origin policy
3. For cross-device sync, implement WebSocket server (future feature)

## Deployment

### For Production Use

1. Deploy to Vercel (click Publish in v0)
2. Update overlay URLs in OBS to production domain
3. Share admin URL with production crew

### Production Branch Policy

- Only changes merged into your designated production branch may deploy to production.
- Use deploy previews and branch deploys for all feature work, staging, and QA.
- Do not use Netlify CLI, MCP, or API to publish production from non-production branches.
- If your production branch is not named `production`, update `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_BRANCH` in `.github/workflows/production-deploy-policy.yml`.
- See `docs/deployment-policy.md` for the process and branch policy.

### Environment Variables

This project uses Supabase for database-backed features and requires the following environment variables for deployment.

Create a local `.env.local` file with:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_publishable_key
```

For production, add the same keys to your host provider's environment settings (for example, Netlify site variables or GitHub repository secrets). Do not commit `.env.local` or real values to the repo.

If you are using Google OAuth with Supabase, also configure your redirect URL in the Supabase Dashboard:

- `https://<your-production-domain>/admin`

This must match the domain used by your deployed app.

If your site is deployed on Netlify, install or update the Next.js plugin in the Netlify dashboard to the latest version:

- plugin: `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`
- desired version: `5.15.11` or later

> If you are developing on Windows, keep the repo on a local drive (for example, `C:\Projects`) rather than a network share or mounted drive. Next.js can warn about a slow filesystem when `.next/dev` is on a network volume.

You can also use the committed `.env.example` file as a reference for the required keys.
